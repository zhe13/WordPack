* 0:no idea about that,make a button for fun when thinking about it.
* 1st step:after talking this idea with theJian,we think it just need enumeration to finish this idea.
so,I want to first use rectangle and triangle shapes to test.And only use One word in same font-size to fill them.
* 2nd step:Still simple shapes,this time I will change the font size.
* 3rd step:try more complex shapes.
