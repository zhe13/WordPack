# WordPack
Filling the shape with words.It should be a project write for my girl.

# What does this project want to do
Just fill a shape with the special words.
It looks cool,does it?
Think about that,You Upload a picture with your girl friend's outline in it.Then,type in your girls's name
and yours,just wait a minute,it comes up.the two names consist of the shape.

# How it works.
It seems to be a tough mission for me,cause I am not good at problem-solving.So I keep note about
my ideas int the following.

var imgData=context.getImageData(x,y,width,height);


```flow
st=>start:main()
e=>end:
```


# Tahnks for theJian & zzm 's suggestion.
# Tracks
* 0:no idea about that,make a button for fun when thinking about it.
* 1st step:after talking this idea with theJian,we think it just need enumeration to finish this idea.
so,I want to first use rectangle and triangle shapes to test.And only use One word in same font-size to fill them.
* 2nd step:Still simple shapes,this time I will change the font size.
* 3rd step:try more complex shapes.
